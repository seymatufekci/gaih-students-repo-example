## Company Management System:

I created 3 classes as Company, Employee and Manager. I determined the names, ages, languages and jobs for all Company members. I determined 'department' for only employees and 'year' for only managers.
I created some functions for classes. For example 'print_dep' prints departments of employees. 
In the end I wanted a name from users. When I take it, I compare the given name with names already know.If there is a match, the languages of the given name are printed. Otherwise it will be printed as an error.
